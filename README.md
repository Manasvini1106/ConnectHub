# ConnectHub
# connectHub - My Project Experience

## Overview
connectHub is a full-stack social network application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 

## Project Scope
The primary goal of connectHub was to create a robust social network platform for developers where users could register, log in, create detailed profiles, and link their social networks seamlessly. It includes job and education details, social network integration, and secure user authentication.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Building the Extensive Backend API
I started by developing a comprehensive backend API using Node.js and Express. This involved creating routes, handling requests, and interacting with the MongoDB database to store user profiles and related information.

### 2. JWT Authentication
I implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication practices to secure the routes and endpoints. This added an extra layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users could access certain application features.

### 3. Seamless React Integration
One of the highlights was elegantly integrating React with the Express backend. Drawing inspiration from the course, I implemented React components, emphasizing React Hooks, Async/Await, and modern coding practices.

### 4. Redux for State Management
Understanding the importance of efficient state management, I incorporated Redux into the project. This involved creating reducers and actions for resources and building container components seamlessly integrated with Redux.

### 5. Testing and Debugging
I extensively tested the application using Postman for API testing and the Redux Chrome extension for testing Redux functionalities. This iterative testing and debugging process ensured a smooth user experience.

### 6. Deployment to Heroku
Upon completing the development phase, I created a build script and initiated the deployment of connectHub to Heroku using Git. While showcasing the project to a broader audience was the initial goal, I encountered unexpected challenges related to the associated costs of Heroku. As a result, I had to reconsider the deployment strategy to ensure the project's accessibility without incurring excessive expenses.

## Learning Experience
Building connectHub provided me with a holistic understanding of full-stack development. I honed my skills in backend API development, frontend integration, state management with Redux, and deployment to a cloud platform. The project also served as a practical application of React Hooks, Async/Await, and modern coding practices.

## Future Enhancements
As I continue to work on connectHub, I plan to implement additional features, enhance the user interface, and explore opportunities for scalability. This project serves as a foundation for ongoing learning and improvement.
